## Why Should We Prefer Semantic HTML Over Non-Semantic Elements like `<div>` and `<span>`?

### We should prefer **semantic HTML** because it improves **accessibility**, **SEO**, and **maintainability**.

1. **Accessibility**:\
   Semantic tags, like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>`, provide meaning to screen readers and assistive technologies, helping users with disabilities navigate the page more easily.

2. **SEO**:\
   Search engines understand semantic tags better, which can improve the page's **search engine ranking**. For example, a `<main>` tag indicates the main content, making it easier for search engines to prioritize important information.

3. **Maintainability**:\
   Semantic HTML is more **readable** and **easier to maintain**. It clearly defines the structure of a webpage, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the code.

4. **Consistency**:\
   Semantic elements often have default behaviors and styles that improve **consistency** across browsers, reducing the need for extra CSS classes or IDs.

### Example:

- **Non-Semantic HTML:**

  ```html
  <div>
    <div class="header">Header</div>
    <div class="content">Content</div>
    <div class="footer">Footer</div>
  </div>
  ```

- **Semantic HTML:**

  ```html
  <header>Header</header>
  <main>Content</main>
  <footer>Footer</footer>
  ```

By using semantic HTML, we create more accessible, SEO-friendly, and maintainable code.

This version adds consistent use of formatting (like adding spaces for readability) and slight improvements to punctuation. It should now be good for interviews or documentation!
