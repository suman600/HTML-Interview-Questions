## What is the difference between block-level and inline elements? Can a block element be inside an inline element

### **Block-Level Elements**
Block-level elements **start on a new line** and expand to take up the **full width** of their parent container.They are used to define **sections, containers, and layout blocks** in a webpage.These elements can contain both **inline** and other **block-level** elements.

Common Tags:\
`<div>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`,\
`<p>`, `<h1>`â€“`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<form>`, `<table>`, `<blockquote>`

### Inline Elements
Inline elements **do not start on a new line**. They only take up as much **horizontal space** as their content needs.They are used to **style or semantically mark up small portions** of content inside block-level elements.Inline elements **cannot contain block-level elements**, only other inline ones.

**Common Tags:**\
`<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<label>`, `<img>`,\
`<abbr>`, `<code>`, `<small>`, `<time>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`


**Can a block-level element go inside an inline element?**\
**No.** That violates the HTML specification and can lead to **unexpected rendering** or broken layouts.\
Browsers may attempt to auto-correct it, but it's bad practice.
